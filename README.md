#Test task Recipe Management App

###The design is simple and lacks responsiveness, as I did not have sufficient time (5 hours) to dedicate to it. However, I aimed to ensure the best possible code quality within the given time constraints.
Additional Libraries and Stack:
The main stack used for this project, as required, includes React, Redux, and Typescript. (I assumed "Redux" included Redux Toolkit and used it from the beginning out of habit). Additionally, the following libraries were utilized:

###Redux Persist: To synchronize the favorites store with local storage.
Firebase For user Registration and Authorization.
React Router DOM: For routing purposes.
React Toastify: To display toast notifications.
React Hook Form + Yup: For form management and validation.
SCSS and MUI: For styling the application.
Axios: For making HTTP requests.
